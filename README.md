# Predicting-Iron-Ore-Impurity
Ore is a naturally occurring solid material from which a metal or valuable mineral can be extracted profitably. The ore comes with naturally occurring impurities. One of such impurities is “Silica”.   During the extraction of minerals from Ore, impurity is measured every hour. If we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, then we can provide such early information to the engineering team for corrective action.   Basis the early information the engineering team will be able to reduce/control the impurity ensuring quality output through extraction from ore. It is also helpful for the environment as we reduce the amount of ore that goes into tailings (are the by products left over from mining and extracting resources).
